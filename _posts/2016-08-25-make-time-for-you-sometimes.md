  I LOVE being a mom! I would do anything for my little girl, like most moms
  would. She lights up my world with her smile, she makes me laugh & I cannot
  imagine my life without her! All that said, sometimes even the most loving
  momâ€™s, need a little break. This picture was taken in 2015 when my husband & I
  took 11 days away from our little girl & traveled to London & Paris. I missed
  my baby dearly & facetimed with her every night. BUT, we still had a great
  time! I loved every minute of it!
